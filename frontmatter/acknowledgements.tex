I would like to thank the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item My supervisor, Dr
Herman Kamper, for continuously supporting me throughout this process and his eagerness to help wherever possible.
Also for supplying useful code to complete some of the tasks within this report.
\item My Parents, Deon and Marijke Bosman, for your continued love and support, without which I would never have made it to this point.
\item My girlfriend, Marizanne Visagie, for working alongside me and keeping me company until early in the morning all those weekends.
\item The Electrical and Electronic Engineering group of 2018, for their fantastic team mentality throughout this degree, always working together to solve problems and never leaving anyone behind.
\item Google and their Google Cloud Platform for their free trial period and Datalab loophole to use more CPUs than allowed, without which the total processing time for this project would have taken more than 16000 hours to complete. 
\end{itemize}
