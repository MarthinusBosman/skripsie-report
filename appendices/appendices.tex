        Outcomes & Outcome Description & Pages \\ 
        \midrule
        \textbf{ELO 1: Problem Solving} & The problem of processing all required tasks within a reasonable time was identified and analysed. Various solutions were researched and tested until a suitable solution (GCP services) was identified and implemented. & \textbf{16-18} \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{ELO 2: Application of scientific and engineering knowledge} & Understanding and applying the concepts of spectrograms, filterbanks, MFCCs and convolution required knowledge of mathematics, advanced frequency and cepstral analysis. Skills in computer science and machine learning were necessary for the application and manipulation of CNNs. & \textbf{5-9, 17-18} \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{ELO 3: Engineering Design} & The high-throughput feature evaluation software architecture was designed, developed, analysed, tested and documented. This architecture was developed to be higly extendable and was communicated clearly, the impact and possible uses described. & \textbf{15-18, 31} \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{ELO 4: Investigations, experiments and data analysis} & Various experiments were conducted to evaluate our models, and we make comparisons with previous work by using consistent evaluation metrics and a benchmark dataset. Results are analysed and conclusions are made. & \textbf{20-26, 29-30} \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{ELO 5: Engineering  methods,  skills  and  tools,  including  Information  Technology} & Software languages such as Python, Cython, Node.js were used.
